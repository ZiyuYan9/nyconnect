Truth in Broadband: Access and Connectivity in NYC
URL: https://tech.cityofnewyork.us/projects/truth-in-broadband/

Principles: Equity, Performance, Affordability, Privacy, & Choice

Data Sources:
1. American Community Survey
2. US Census
3. FCC From 477 (self reported by companies)

Broadband: FCC says it's speed >25 megabits/sec for download, and upload >3 Mbps. Standard may go up in the future depending on FCC or NYC Govt

* FCC Form 477 has max advertized upload/download speeds and the infrastructure used
* * Not used to assess Broadband adoption, not geo granular enough, data gaps, price not reported
* ACS is used to assess broadband adoption
* * But ACS defines broadband differently, so it's used for equity measurement not performance

Equity: 

In NYC, 31% have no broadband subscription, 56% of lowest-income (<20k) don't have broadband
Highest Income (>$130K) only ~10% don't have broadband subscription (ACS 2016)
Elderly (65+) are 1.5x more likely not to have broadband
Black/Hispanic, less educated, unemployed people usually have lower rates of having broadband subscription
There's a correlation between a subscription and having an electronic device

Performance: 

Idea is that quality/availability should increase with time
Nearly all Census Blocks with 1 25 MBPS (download) service option available (2016)
Nearly half (44%) of biz with access to 1 Gbps speed (download). Driver of fiber cost is distance to provider's already available fiber

Affordability:

Cost should not be an impediment to accessibility.

Privacy:

...

Choice:

Limited by reporting done on the census block level. 
69% of households with <=2 providers
72% of small businesses with only 1/2 broadband provider choice
14% no choice for fiber provider
